# Refined Hacker News

> Hacker News, but refined.

This is a small browser that tweaks a few stuff on Hacker News to make the experience better, while keeping the core design principles and place.

Heavily inspired by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s extension [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github).
