# Refined Hacker News

> âœ¨ Hacker News, but refined.

## About

This is a small browser that tweaks a few stuff on Hacker News to make the experience better, while keeping the core design principles in place.

Inspired by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s extension [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github).

## To-do

### Extension

- [x] Options

### Code

- [x] When features are "add"ed, the details object containing information about the feature should include a check whether to see if being logged in is required to access the feature. This will help in removing extra checks from all features. Something like: `login_required: true`

- [x] In the feaure details, make it something like:

```js
...
pages: {
    include: [...],
    exclude: [...]
}
...
```
